        <p>Adobong manok, or Filipino chicken 
            adobo, is the national dish of 
            the Philippines. It is popular 
            because of its simplicity, 
            delicious flavor, and tender 
            chicken. <br>“Adobo” is a cooking 
            method that involves braising a 
            protein in a vinegar-based sauce. Chicken adobo consists of chicken
             thighs and drumsticks <br>that 
             are marinated in a mixture 
             of soy sauce, vinegar, 
             garlic, brown sugar, black 
             peppercorns, and bay leaves. 
             <br>The chicken is then pan-seared and simmered in the marinade until tender and cooked. 
             <br>The adobo sauce cooks down into a thick, aromatic sauce that tastes tangy, sweet, and salty. 
            Chicken adobo is served with a 
            side of steamed white rice for 
            lunch or dinner.</p>

            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix the garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, brown sugar, water, black peppercorns, and bay leaves. Then add the chicken and combine. Cover 
                    and marinate for at least 3 
                    hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>In a large braiser or pot over 
                    medium-high heat, heat cooking 
                    oil until hot. 
                    Remove the chicken from the 
                    marinade (reserving the marinade) 
                    and sear the chicken in batches for 
                    about 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour the marinade back into the braiser and bring to a simmer over 
                    medium-high heat. Then add the chicken 
                    and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once the chicken has reached a 
                    boil, reduce the heat to low, 
                    cover, and gently simmer for 
                    30 minutes. Then flip the 
                    chicken, cover, and cook for 
                    an additional 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Garnish the chicken adobo 
                    with green onions and 
                    serve with steamed white rice.</li>

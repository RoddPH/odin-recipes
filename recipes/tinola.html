    <h2>Tinola is a Filipino soup
        usually served as a main
        course with white rice.
        <br>Traditionally, the dish is
        cooked with chicken or fish,
        wedges of papaya <br>and/or
        chayote, and leaves of the
        siling labuyo chili pepper in
        <br>broth flavored with ginger,
        onions, and fish sauce.
    </h2>

    <p>Tinolang Manok is the ultimate
        comfort food! Made of chicken,
        green papaya, fresh spinach,
        and ginger-flavored broth,
        this Filipino soup is
        hearty, healthy, and tasty. <br>Tinolang Manok is a great tasting
        and healthy dish to
        prepare for your family.
        It is easy to cook and
        friendly on the budget. This goes into my #2 dish with Adobo being first.</p>

        <li>5 cups of water</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot over medium heat,
            heat oil. Add onions, ginger,
            and garlic and cook until
            softened.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 to 7 minutes or
            until chicken starts to change
            color and juices run clear.</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce and cook,
            stirring occasionally,
            for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add water and bring to a boil,
            skimming scum that floats on
            top. Lower heat, cover and
            simmer for about 30 to 35 minutes or
            until chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add papaya and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes
            or until tender yet crisp.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add spinach and push down into broth.
            Cook until just wilted. Serve hot.</li>
